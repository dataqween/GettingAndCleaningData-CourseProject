# Data Set Information

The experiments for this data were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six 
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on the waist. 
Using the smartphone device's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the researchers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity 
at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into 
two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. Data for this experiment was collected by 
Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto and Xavier Parra.

# Steps Performed

* Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
